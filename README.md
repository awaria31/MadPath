# MadPath
A Java application that models the UW–Madison campus as a directed graph and uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest path between any two landmarks.

# UW–Madison's Shortest Path

## Overview
This project is a Java application that computes the shortest path between any two locations on the UW–Madison campus.  
The campus is represented as a directed graph where:
- **Nodes** correspond to campus landmarks.  
- **Edges** are weighted based on the distance between landmarks.  

## Features
- Efficiently modeled the campus using a directed graph.  
- Stored nodes in a hashmap to allow **O(1)** insertion, deletion, and duplicate prevention.  
- Implemented **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute shortest paths.  
- Utilized a **priority queue** to prioritize nodes with the lowest edge weights.  

## Skills & Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **Core Concepts:** Data Structures, Graph Theory, Spanning Trees  
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Priority Queue  

## Example Use Case
- Input: Two landmarks on the UW–Madison campus.  
- Output: The shortest path and total distance between them.
